                Thirty years ago, the Omnics declared war. The nations of the world had no answer, until they called
                upon a small group of <a href="https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes">heroes</a>. <a
                    href="https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/">Overwatch</a>
                was created to rescue humanity from the Omnic Crisis. We became
                the greatest champions of peace and progress mankind has ever seen! You were chosen because you had
                powers and abilities that made youâ€” You joined because you... You already know this... Look, the people
                decided they were better off without us. They even called us criminals! They tore our family apart. But
                look around! Someone has to do something! We have to do something! We can make a difference again. The
                world needs us now, more than ever! Are you with me?
