                <a href="https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/dva/">D.Va</a> is a former professional gamer who now
                uses
                her skills to pilot a state-of-the-art mech in defense
                of her homeland.

                Twenty years ago, South Korea was attacked by a colossal omnic monstrosity that rose from the depths of
                the East China Sea. The massive, lumbering construct caused catastrophic damage to coastal cities before
                it was driven back beneath the waves. In response, the South Korean government developed a mechanized
                armored drone unit, called MEKA, to protect urban environments in future engagements with the omnic
                threat.
