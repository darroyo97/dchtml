            <p>
                <a href="https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/dva/">D.Va</a> is a former professional gamer who now
                uses
                her skills to pilot a state-of-the-art mech in defense
                of her homeland. </p>
            <p>Twenty years ago, South Korea was attacked by a colossal omnic monstrosity that
                rose from the depths of the East China Sea. The massive, lumbering construct caused catastrophic
                damage to coastal cities before it was driven back beneath the waves. In response, the South Korean
                government developed a mechanized armored drone unit, called MEKA, to protect urban environments in
                future engagements with the omnic threat.</p>
            <p>The government's fears proved to be well founded, as a
                disturbing pattern of attacks emerged. Every few years, the monstrosity would rise from the sea to
                assault South Korea and its neighbors. The omnic learned from these encounters, often reconfiguring
                itself in a different form and appearing with new weapons and capabilities. Each incident ended in a
                stalemate, with the monstrosity defeated but not destroyed. </p>
            <p>As the omnic continued to adapt, it
                eventually disrupted MEKA's drone-control networks, forcing the military to place pilots in the
                mechs. Scrambling to find suitable candidates, the government turned to the country's professional
                gamers, who possessed the necessary reflexes and instincts to operate the mechs' advanced weapons
                systems. Top stars were drafted, including reigning world champion Hana Song, also known as "D.Va."
                Famous for her elite skills, D.Va was a fierce competitor who played to win at all costs, and she
                had a well-earned reputation for showing no mercy to her opponents. </p>
            <p>Seeing her new mission as a
                game, D.Va fearlessly charges into battle alongside the rest of her MEKA unit, ready to spring to
                her nation's defense at a moment's notice. Recently, she has begun to stream combat operations to
                her adoring fans, and her growing following has turned her into a global icon.
