    <h1>TOGETHER WE ARE STRONG.</h1>
    <div class="main_container">
        <div class="left">
            <p>
                <a href="https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/zarya/">Aleksandra Zaryanova</a> is one of the world's
                strongest women,
                a celebrated athlete who sacrificed personal
                glory to protect her family, friends, and country in a time of war.</p>

            <p>Aleksandra was born in a remote Siberian village that was on the front lines of the Omnic Crisis, which
                began some thirty years ago. Although Russian forces defeated the robots and shut down their omnium, the
                region was devastated by the conflict. Only a child at the time, Aleksandra was surrounded by the
                post-war destruction, and as she grew older, she swore that she would gain the strength to help her
                people recover.
            </p>
            <p>
                Focusing on weightlifting and bodybuilding, Aleksandra was identified by the national athletics program
                as a potential star. She trained extensively, moving up the ranks while representing her country, and
                was expected to shatter longstanding records in the upcoming world championships.
            </p>
            <p>
                But on the eve of the tournament, an attack came from the long-dormant Siberian omnium, and her village
                was thrust into war once again. Aleksandra immediately withdrew from the competition and rushed home to
                enlist in the local defense forces, sacrificing the life of fame and fortune she might have had.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now she servesâ€”a symbol to some, a stalwart fellow soldier to others. But for Aleksandra, it is a chance
                to use her great strength to protect the ones she loves.
